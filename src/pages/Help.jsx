                <h5>Slow Loading Times</h5>
                <p>Problem: Websites with heavy graphics, advertisements, or poorly optimized videos can load slowly, causing frustration and buffering issues.<br></br>
                Solution: Optimize the website by compressing images, using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for faster loading, and reducing the number of scripts. For viewers, a faster internet connection and closing other tabs can help.</p>

                     Intrusive Ads and Pop-ups
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                    Problem: Many movie websites are cluttered with pop-ups and ads, often leading to accidental clicks that disrupt the viewing experience or even open malicious pages.<br></br>
                    Solution: Use ad blockers or premium subscriptions if available. Website owners can improve user experience by limiting ads, particularly pop-ups, or by using less intrusive ad formats, like banner ads.

                  Low-Quality Video Streaming 
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                  Problem: Some sites offer only low-resolution streaming, which can be a letdown, especially on larger screens.
                Solution: Websites can offer multiple streaming qualities (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p) to allow viewers to choose based on their internet speed. Viewers may also look for sites with better quality or enable HD streaming if available.

                  Lack of Compatibility with Mobile Devices
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                  Problem: Some movie websites don’t have a mobile-friendly interface, making navigation difficult or rendering the video player unusable.
                   Solution: Websites should employ responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices. Users can try watching movies in mobile browsers that support desktop mode as a workaround if the site isn’t optimized.

                  Unreliable or Broken Links
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                  Problem: Many movie sites rely on third-party streaming links, which may be broken or removed, frustrating viewers trying to access a specific film.
                  Solution: Website administrators should regularly check and update broken links. Viewers can use websites that have a good reputation for reliable hosting, or look for the movie on another reputable platform if links are consistently unreliable.
